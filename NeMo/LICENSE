NVIDIA NEMO FRAMEWORK MULTIMODAL PRE-RELEASE EVALUATION LICENSE

IMPORTANT NOTICE – PLEASE READ AND AGREE BEFORE USING THE CONTAINER. This license
agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you, whether an individual or
entity ("you”) and NVIDIA Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of an early
access version of the NVIDIA NeMo framework multimodal container and all its contents
(“CONTAINER”). This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of
majority in the country in which the CONTAINER is used. If you don’t have the required
age or authority to accept this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use the CONTAINER. You
agree to use the CONTAINER only for purposes that are permitted by this Agreement and
any applicable law or regulation in the relevant jurisdictions.

1. License.
1.1 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA grants you a non-exclusive,
revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as expressly granted in this
Agreement), license to: (a) install and use copies of the CONTAINER, and (b) modify and
create derivative works of sample or example source code delivered by NVIDIA as part
of the CONTAINER (if applicable), all the foregoing only for your internal use to
evaluate or develop and test services and applications with the CONTAINER, without use
in production.

2. Limitations.
Your license to use the CONTAINER and derivative works of the CONTAINER is restricted
as follows:

2.1 The CONTAINER may run on any computing system with or without NVIDIA GPUs, except
for the NVIDIA proprietary software (such as CUDA and TensorRT software) in the
CONTAINER which is licensed only to run on systems with NVIDIA GPUs. The NVIDIA
proprietary software in the CONTAINER may be present on systems without NVIDIA GPUs,
as long as it is not running on such systems. For components governed by open source
software licenses, see the information in the “Components Under Other Licenses” section
below.

2.2 The CONTAINER and derivative works may not be used in any commercial-ready products
or services, or separately to even for development, test or evaluation of other NVIDIA
non-NVIDIA products or services.

2.3 You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the CONTAINER components
provided in binary form, nor attempt in any other manner to obtain source code of such
CONTAINER components.

2.4 You may not change or remove copyright or other proprietary notices in the
CONTAINER.

2.5 Except as expressly granted in this Agreement, you may not copy, sell, rent,
sublicense, transfer, distribute, modify or create derivative works of the CONTAINER,
or make its functionality available to others.

2.6 Data generated with use of the CONTAINER may not be used for deployment purposes.

2.7 You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any technical limitation, encryption,
security, digital rights management or authentication mechanism in the CONTAINER.

2.8 You may not replace any NVIDIA software components that are governed by this
Agreement with other software that implements NVIDIA APIs.

2.9 You may not use the CONTAINER for the purpose of developing competing products or
technologies or assisting a third party in such activities.

2.10 You may not use the CONTAINER in any manner that would cause it to become subject
to an open source software license; subject to the terms in the “Components Under Other
Licenses” section below.

2.11 Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not use the
CONTAINER provided under this Agreement and derivative works in a system or
application where the use of or application where the use of or failure of such system
or application developed with CONTAINER provided by NVIDIA could result in injury,
death or catastrophic damage. NVIDIA will not be liable to you or any third party, in
whole or in part, for any claims or damages arising from these uses. You are solely
responsible for ensuring that systems and applications developed with the CONTAINER
as a whole include sufficient safety and redundancy features and comply with all
applicable legal and regulatory standards and requirements.

3. Your Privacy: Collection and Use of Information.
Please review the NVIDIA Privacy Policy, located at
https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/privacy-policy, which explains NVIDIA’s
policy for collecting and using data, as well as visit the NVIDIA Privacy Center,
located at https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/privacy-center, to manage your consent and
privacy preferences. NVIDIA may require certain personal information such as name,
email address and entitlement information including survey responses to deliver or
provide the CONTAINER to you.

4. Authorized Users.
You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of your subsidiary(ies) to
access and use the CONTAINER from your secure network to perform the work authorized
by this Agreement on your behalf. If you are an academic institution, you may allow
users enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and use the CONTAINER
as authorized by this Agreement from your secure network. You are responsible for the
compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your authorized users. Any act or
omission that if committed by you would constitute a breach of this Agreement will be
deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement if committed by your authorized users.

5. Confidentiality.
You agree that you will not use, nor authorize others to use, NVIDIA Confidential
Information, except as necessary for the performance of this Agreement, and that you
will not disclose NVIDIA Confidential Information to any third party, except to
permitted users under this Agreement that have a need to know such Confidential
Information for the purpose of this Agreement, provided that each such recipient is
subject to a written agreement that includes confidentiality obligations consistent
with these terms. You agree to use all reasonable efforts to maintain the
confidentiality of NVIDIA Confidential Information in your possession or control, but
in no event less than the efforts that you ordinarily use with respect to your own
Confidential Information of similar nature and importance. “Confidential Information”
means the output, and any results of benchmarking or other competitive analysis or
regression or performance data relating to the CONTAINER.

6. Pre-Release Versions.
CONTAINER versions or specific features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early
access or otherwise as pre-release may not be fully functional, may contain errors or
design flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of NVIDIA offerings. You may use
a pre-release CONTAINER at your own risk, understanding that such versions are not
intended for use in production or business-critical systems. NVIDIA may choose not to
make available a commercial version of any pre-release CONTAINER. NVIDIA may also
choose to abandon development and terminate the availability of a pre-release CONTAINER
at any time without liability.

7. Updates.
NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or other updates to the
CONTAINER. Unless the updates are provided with their separate governing terms, they
are deemed part of the CONTAINER licensed to you as provided in this Agreement.

8. Components Under Other Licenses.
The CONTAINER may include or be distributed with components provided with separate
legal notices or terms that accompany the components, such as open source software
terms and other license terms ("Other Licenses”). The components are subject to the
applicable Other Licenses, including any proprietary notices, disclaimers,
requirements and extended use rights; except that this Agreement will prevail regarding
the use of third-party open source software, unless a third-party open source software
license requires its license terms to prevail. Open source software license means any
software, data or documentation subject to any license identified as an open source
license by the Open Source Initiative (http://opensource.org), Free Software Foundation (http://www.fsf.org) or
other similar open source organization or listed by the Software Package Data Exchange
(SPDX) Workgroup under the Linux Foundation (http://www.spdx.org).

You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to obtain any additional
third-party licenses required to make, have made, use, have used, sell, import, and
offer for sale your products or services that include or incorporate components under
Other Licenses, including, without limitation, audio and/or video encoders and decoders
and implementations of technical standards. NVIDIA does not grant to you under this
Agreement any necessary patent or other rights, including standard essential patent
rights, with respect to components under Other Licenses.

9. Termination.
This Agreement will automatically terminate without notice from NVIDIA if you fail to
comply with any of the terms in this Agreement or if you commence or participate in any
legal proceeding against NVIDIA with respect to the CONTAINER. Additionally, either
party may terminate this Agreement at any time with prior written notice to the other
party. Upon any termination, you must stop using and destroy all copies of the CONTAINER
and derivative works. Upon written request, you will certify in writing that you have
complied with your commitments under this section. All provisions will survive
termination, except for the licenses granted to you.

10. Ownership.
The CONTAINER, including all intellectual property rights, is and will remain the sole
and exclusive property of NVIDIA or its licensors. Except as expressly granted in this
Agreement, (i) NVIDIA reserves all rights, interests, and remedies in connection with
the CONTAINER, and (ii) no other license or right is granted to you by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. You agree to cooperate with NVIDIA and provide reasonably
requested information to verify your compliance with this Agreement.

11. Feedback.
You may, but you are not obligated to, provide suggestions, requests, fixes,
modifications, enhancements, or other feedback regarding the CONTAINER
(collectively, “Feedback”). Feedback, even if designated as confidential by you,
will not create any confidentiality obligation for NVIDIA or its affiliates. If
you provide Feedback, you hereby grant NVIDIA, its affiliates and its designees
a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free,
fully paid-up and transferable license, under your intellectual property rights,
to publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, use, make, have made, sell,
offer for sale, distribute (through multiple tiers of distribution), import,
create derivative works of and otherwise commercialize and exploit the Feedback
at NVIDIA’s discretion. You will not give Feedback (i) that you have reason to
believe is subject to any restriction that impairs the exercise of the grant
stated in this section, such as third-party intellectual property rights; or
(ii) subject to license terms which seek to require any product incorporating or
developed using such Feedback, or other intellectual property of NVIDIA or its
affiliates, to be licensed to or otherwise shared with any third party.

12. Disclaimer of Warranties.
THE CONTAINER IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA AS-IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS. TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NVIDIA DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND
REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, RELATING TO
OR ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES
OF TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
USAGE OF TRADE AND COURSE OF DEALING. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, NVIDIA
DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE CONTAINER WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; THAT ANY
DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; THAT ANY CERTAIN CONTENT WILL BE AVAILABLE;
OR THAT THE CONTAINER IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.  NO
INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY NVIDIA WILL IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF ANY
WARRANTY EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT. NVIDIA does not warrant or assume
responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any third-party information,
text, graphics, links contained in THE CONTAINER.

13. Limitations of Liability.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA BE
LIABLE FOR ANY (I) INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, OR (II) DAMAGES FOR THE (A) COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR (B)
LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUES, USE, DATA OR GOODWILL ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, AND EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A PARTY'S REMEDIES FAIL THEIR ESSENTIAL
PURPOSE.

ADDITIONALLY, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NVIDIA’S TOTAL
CUMULATIVE AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS OR
CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED FIVE U.S.
DOLLARS (US$5).

14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction.
This Agreement will be governed in all respects by the laws of the United States
and the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of laws
principles or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
of Goods. The state and federal courts residing in Santa Clara County,
California will have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute or claim arising
out of or related to this Agreement, and the parties irrevocably consent to
personal jurisdiction and venue in those courts; except that either party may
apply for injunctive remedies or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief in
any jurisdiction.

15. No Assignment.
NVIDIA may assign, delegate or transfer its rights or obligations under this
Agreement by any means or operation of law. You may not, without NVIDIA’s prior
written consent, assign, delegate or transfer any of your rights or obligations
under this Agreement by any means or operation of law, and any attempt to do so
is null and void.

16. Waiver.
No failure or delay by a party to enforce any Agreement term or obligation will
operate as a waiver by that party, nor prevent the enforcement of such term or
obligation later.

17. Export.
You agree to comply with all applicable export, import, trade and economic
sanctions laws and regulations, including U.S. Export Administration Regulations
and Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations. These laws include
restrictions on destinations, end-users and end-use.

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
